     * Class is a representation of a generic entity from real-life.

     * Syntax to create object of a class:
     * let objName = new ClassName(); 
     * 
     * new ClassName(); --> code to create class object
     * objName --> variable in which we are storing the class object.
     * 
     * 
     * When we create object of a class
     *      -> the object gets it's own set of (non-static) global variables with default values; and
     *          ALL objects shares the static variables.
     *      -> using the object, we can access the variables and functions present in that class
     *
